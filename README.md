# Phlex examples

This repository contains examples of the use of the [Phlex framework](https://github.com/framework-r-d/phlex).

## Building this repository

To use the code in this repository, first install it:

```console
git clone -b phlex-v0.1 https://github.com/Framework-R-D/phlex-examples.git
```

Now create a build directory:
```console
mkdir build-phlex-examples
cd build-phlex-examples
```

The repository can now be easily built by activating [the environment you created when installing Phlex](https://github.com/Framework-R-D/phlex/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md#creating-and-installing-the-phlex-environment):

```console
spack env activate my-phlex-environment
spack load cmake gcc@14  # adjust if you used a different compiler for phlex
cmake ../phlex-examples
make -j 12  # choose a suitable number of jobs for your machine
```

## Running the code

### Add your build directory to `PHLEX_PLUGIN_PATH`

```console
# Make sure you do this from your build directory
export PHLEX_PLUGIN_PATH=${PWD}:${PHLEX_PLUGIN_PATH}
```

You should now be able to run a simple `phlex` job:

### Job with C++ algorithms

```console
phlex -c ../phlex-examples/test-cpp-workflow.jsonnet
```

The output should look like:

```console
Using configuration file: ../phlex-examples/test-cpp-workflow.jsonnet
[2025-12-22 13:17:51.496] [info] Number of worker threads: 24

```

### Job with Python algorithms

To run a job that uses a Python algorithm, the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable must be adjusted to include the directory with the Python module:

```console
export PYTHONPATH=$(realpath ../phlex-examples):${PYTHONPATH}
phlex -c ../phlex-examples/test-py-workflow.jsonnet
```

The output should look like:

```console
Using configuration file: ../phlex-examples/test-py-workflow.jsonnet
